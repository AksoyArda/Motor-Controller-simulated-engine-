# Motor-Controller-simulated-engine-
A combined software-hardware project that simulates an engine in Arduino and drives a physical dashboard. The dashboard displays speed, RPM, gear position, and includes a limiter LED, all synchronized with real-time simulation data. Control is done via serial terminal for throttle and engine on/off.
